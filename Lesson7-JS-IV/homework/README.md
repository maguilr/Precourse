# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
	"These hold a lot of information about one thing. This is the same as the contact app on your phone."
	
	* Properties
	"Properties hold is the information in the object and usually are characteristics about the object. This is similiar to have someones contact information where you have their name, phone number, and could have location."
	
	* Methods
	"This is a function stored on an object. Methods are pre-programmed functions that will execute some some function such as .length, .pop, .push. This is simliar to attaching a printer to your computer because it now has a new object that has functionality."
	
	* for in loop
	"This is similiar to the previous loop we learned for using in arrays. This will just loop over the key:value of each property in the object."
	
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation
	"these are both ways of accessing property values in the object. The dot notation is prefered simply because it looks cleaner."

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
